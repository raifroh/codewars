// Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

// 89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1

// 695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

// 46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

// Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p

// we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such that the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n.
// In other words:

// Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k

// If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.

// Note: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.

// digPow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1
// digPow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k
// digPow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
// digPow(46288, 3) should return 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51


//parameters we are given n which is the base number to multiply by/break up
//so if we get 89, 1 that means we need to split this into 8^1 + 9^2 which equals 89.
//now is there anything times n aka 89 which equals 89? yes, 1
//what about 46288, 3 which would be 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688
//is 2360688 % 46288 === 0? if so, return 2360688/46288
//we also now need to split n by '' and then raise it by the power of p and then p+1
//return -1 if the product is not divisible by n, return the product / n if it is
//example digPow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2



const digPow = (n, p) =>{
    //so we need to turn n into a string, split it, then make it a number again
    //as part of an array (using map?) so we can use a loop to perform operations on it
